JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

computers distinguish between numbers, such as the 
number 12, 
and strings, such as 
"12", 
"dog", 
or 
"123 cats

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.


var myName;
